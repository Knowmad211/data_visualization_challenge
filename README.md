# data_visualization_challenge

This project was completed using our class exercies, notes, as well as collaboration with other classmates, notably Paolo Arciaga. He helped me greatly and made sure I could refine my code to make it simpler. Specifically I needed help with the scatterplot and regression calculations. Because of the Holidays, tutoring was not immediately available, but Paolo's tutor was able to help him, and I was able to benefit from their session.
All data was provided to us along with the starter code, which is also uploaded with the analysis in the "Starter_Code" folder.
